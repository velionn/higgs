=========

This project is a modern reimplementation of the research paper "Searching for Exotic Particles in High-Energy Physics with Deep Learning" by Baldi, Sadowski, and Whiteson. Instead of using the original Pylearn2/Theano stack, this project using PyTorch.

## Reference

## Usage Guide

### 1\. Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Repository** 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/velionn/higgs.git
cd higgs
```

2. **Download the Dataset**

* Download the `HIGGS.csv` dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository: HIGGS Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/280/higgs).
* Extract and place the `HIGGS.csv` file (approx. 8GB) into the `data/raw/`.

3.  **Create a Virtual Environment**

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

4.  **Install Libraries**

```bash
pip3 install torch torchvision
```

*Install other libraries:*

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2\. Running Training

Training is executed using the `train.py` script, which requires a configuration file as an argument. All experiment configurations are defined in the `configs/` folder.

* **Command Syntax:**

```bash
python train.py --config [PATH_KE_FILE_CONFIG]
```

* **Example:**
To train a 4-layer with all features, run:

```bash
python train.py --config configs/layers4_width300_lr0001_wd00001_all.yaml
```

The best performing model will be automatically saved in the `models/` folder.

### 3\. Running Evaluation

After a model has been trained, you can evaluate its final performance on the test set using `evaluate.py`. This script uses the same configuration file that was uset for training

* **Command Syntax:**

```bash
python evaluate.py --config [PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE]
```

* **Example:**
To evaluate the model you just trained above, run:

```bash
python evaluate.py --config configs/layers4_width300_lr0001_wd00001_all.yaml
```
The evaluation result (AUC, accuracy, loss) will be printed to the terminal and saved to a `.json` file in the `result/metrisc/` folder
